![Smart Contracts Flow-Chart](MakerBadges.png)

### [MakerBadges](./contracts/MakerBadges.sol)
> MakerBadges to check for activities on MakerDAO ecosystem and keep track of redeemers

To enable MakerBadges to check on-chain for activities on MakerDAO ecosystem we're using three interface to map the functions that we'll use:
- **Chai**: to check if a user has accrued 1 or more Dai from DSR (Pot), via **dai()** used in Chai contract to return the **wad** or the current accrued Dai interest in DSR.  
To check redeemer activities on Pot it uses **chaiChallenge(uint templateId)** function.    
- **DSChief**: to check if a user is voting in an Executive Spell via **votes(address)** a getter function to check who is currently voting.  
To check redeemer activities on DSChief it uses **chiefChallenge(uint templateId)** function.    
- **Flipper**: to check for high bidder in the current Bid in Collateral Auctions via **bids(id)** a getter function of current Bid on Flipper to check for **bids(id).guy** the high bidder.   
To check redeemer activities on Flipper it uses **flipperChallenge(uint templateId, uint bidId)** function.  

The functions to check on-chain for activities on Maker Ecosystem will keep track of the caller address into the OpenZeppelin EnumerableSet.AddressSet **redeemers** by templateId that will be verified in BadgeFactory via **verify(uint templateId, address guy)** function linked to it, to allow a redeemer to activate a Non-transferable Badge.

MakerBadges, let the admin to set (via **setRootHashes()**) an array of root hashes, called **roots**, ordered by template Id to allow redemeers checked off-chain for activities via TheGraph on the front-end, and stored into a Merkle Tree, to activate Badge.
The getter function **roots(uint templateId)** is then linked to BadgeFactory and checked via OpenZeppelin MerkleProof.sol **verify()** function.

The contract also inherits OpenZeppelic AccessControl.sol, allowing the owner of the contract to be set as Default Admin, Pauser and Amdin, to add an Admin via **addAdmin()** and remove an Admin via **removeAdmin()** functions as well as to **pause()**, **unpause()** functions in case of emergency (Circuit Breaker Design Pattern).  

In order to integrate OpenGSNv2, MakerBadges inherits BaseRelayRecipient and IKnowForwarderAddress and implement the following changes:  

- msg.sender is replaced by **_msgSender()**.  
- **trustedForwarder** is set in the constructor with the address deployed on [Kovan](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn/releases/tag/v2.0.1).    
- **_msgSender()** function is added to override OpenZeppelin Context and OpenGSN BaseRelayRecipient _msgSender().  
- **_msgData()** function is added to override OpenZeppelin Context and OpenGSN BaseRelayRecipient _msgData().  

### [BadgeRoles](./contracts/BadgeRoles.sol)
> BadgeRoles Access Management for Default Admin, Templater and Pauser Role

BadgeRoles inherits the OpenZeppelin AccessControl.sol, allowing the owner of the contract to be set as Default Admin, Pauser and also as Templater, to add a Templater via **addTemplater()** and remove a Templater via **removeTemplater()** functions.  

In order to integrate OpenGSNv2, BadgeRoles inherits BaseRelayRecipient and IKnowForwarderAddress and implement the following changes:  

- msg.sender is replaced by **_msgSender()**.  
- **trustedForwarder** is set in the constructor with the address deployed on [Kovan](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn/releases/tag/v2.0.1).    
- **_msgSender()** function is added to override OpenZeppelin Context and OpenGSN BaseRelayRecipient _msgSender().  
- **_msgData()** function is added to override OpenZeppelin Context and OpenGSN BaseRelayRecipient _msgData().  

### [BadgeFactory](./contracts/BadgeFactory.sol)
> BadgeFactory to manage Templates and activate Non-transferable Badges for redeemers

To enable BadgeFactory to verify redeemers checked on-chain/off-chain for activities on MakerDAO ecosystem, when they try to redeem their Badge, we're using the interface InsigniaDAO to map the function we'll use.  

In particular, we'll use:
- **verify()** to verify redeemers checked on-chain.
- **roots()** a getter function to return root by templated Id to be verified via MerkleProof.sol **verify()** function, allowing redeemers checked off-chain and stored into a Merkle Tree to be able to redeem Badges.  

A Merkle Tree is generated for every Template and the root hash is updated by owner of MakerBadges daily to allow batches of redeemers to be checked and to redeem Badges.  

BadgeFactory inherits BadgeRoles, allowing a Templater to create a new template via **createTemplate()** specifying name, description and image. A Templater can also update the template info via **updateTemplate()**.

It also inherits ERC721, where the **_transfer()** has been overridden to implement the non-transferable feature, allowing redeemers checked on-chain/offchain to redeem a Badge for a specific activity on MakerDAO ecosystem via **activateBadge()** that will verify if the caller is a redeemer and then will allow the caller to mint a new Non-transferable Badge with tokenURI stored on IPFS (eg. "ipfs.json").  
To avoid that a redeemer could activate the same Badge twice or more, **redeemed** is introduced to check if a Badge is already activeted and revert the transaction.  

In order to integrate OpenGSNv2, BadgeFactory inherits BadgeRoles and implement the following changes:  

**_msgSender()** function is added to override OpenZeppelin Context and BadgeRoles _msgSender().    
**_msgData()** function is added to override OpenZeppelin Context and BadgeRoles _msgData().  

During deployment the contract sets the following ERC721 metadata:
- name: "MakerBadges"
- symbol: "MAKER"
- baseURI: "https://badges.makerdao.com/token/"  

### [BadgePaymaster](./contracts/BadgePaymaster.sol)
> BadgePaymaster to pay for user's meta-transactions  

In order to pay for user's meta-transaction BadgePaymaster inherits OpenGSNv2 BasePaymaster and IForwarder and implement the following functions:

- **preRelayedCall()**
- **postRelayedCall()**

Once deployed, BadgePaymaster owner need to set the RelayHub contract address via **setRelayHub()** as well as the Trusted Forwarder via **setTrustedForwarder** and specify the target contracts to pay gas for via **setTarget()**.

Finally, the owner just need to fund the contract sending ether to BadgePaymaster contract address and the balance will be automatically updated in RelayHub contract. The owner can at any time withdraw the paymaster balance via **withdrawAll()**.
